# 👋 Hi there — I'm Samskruthi Musku

I'm a passionate Data Analyst with 3.9+ years of experience turning raw data into actionable insights across Banking, Medical, and Oil & Energy sectors. I specialize in analytics, dashboarding, and building end-to-end data solutions using tools like SQL, Python, Power BI, and cloud platforms.

🎓 Currently pursuing my Master’s in Information Technology at the University of Cincinnati (GPA: 3.8), with a focus on cloud data engineering and machine learning.

💡 I’ve built fraud detection systems, automated ETL pipelines, and developed AI-powered business intelligence apps using LLMs and Streamlit. My work has improved decision-making, reduced risk, and saved time for multiple teams.
